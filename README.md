## ABOUT

![Image shows the doorway of an old rundown factory with pipes and machinery surrounding the doorway. The room is illuminated with dingy, yellow-tinted lights. Beyond the doorway is a terminal that glows in red, requesting the user to input a code. Above the doorway is a red timer at 4 minutes 57 seconds.](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1336467829758885962/1370863336299827300/image.png?ex=68210b78&is=681fb9f8&hm=f448ec136547cd9eb3bc3ef1261a35d2cc287258eb58edb554779ef075b8ea6e&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=1522&height=856)

# Known bugs...
- Can't click on keyboard to enter code within console room
- You spawn at a different place than your avatar. Press home button on right hand controller and hold down the home button.
- If you walk on an object, you will fly. No idea why.
- Sliding Keycards is finicky
- "Stick 'em in a stew" component of game will - on proper completion - spawn the terminal sideways. Also, the code isn't right.
- Look, making a multiplayer game in VR is a little hard!
